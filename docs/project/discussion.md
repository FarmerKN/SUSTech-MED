# Discussion
In this study, we builds on previous research by utilizing the PVC injection system to experimentally address the infection caused by Vibrio cholerae. We successfully constructed specific plasmids and expressed PVC proteins in Escherichia coli, followed by conducting a killing assay using the dot plate method to verify the potential efficacy of the PVC system against Vibrio cholerae. The experimental results tentatively indicate that the PVC system has potential in combating infections by Vibrio cholerae. Further insights from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations revealed the destructive effect of PVC proteins on Vibrio cholerae, offering preliminary theoretical evidence for the application of the PVC system in medical treatment.

However, there are several limitations in the experimental design and execution that warrant consideration:
1. Limitations in sample size: The sample size used in the dot plate assay was relatively small, which may not fully represent the actual antibacterial effectiveness of PVC proteins. Future studies should increase the sample size to more accurately evaluate the bactericidal efficacy of PVC proteins.
2. Control of experimental conditions: The experimental process may have been influenced by external environmental factors such as temperature and humidity, which could impact the activity of PVC proteins. Subsequent experiments need to rigorously control these conditions to minimize potential interference with the experimental outcomes.
3. Targeted modifications of the PVC system: Although we made specific modifications to the tail fiber protein of the PVC system to enhance its targeted killing capability against Vibrio cholerae, the experimental results did not adequately validate the effectiveness of these modifications. Future research should focus on optimizing the modification strategies to enhance the PVC system's targeting of specific bacterial populations.
4. Research gap on bacterial resistance: This study did not investigate the potential for Vibrio cholerae to develop resistance to the PVC system. Given that resistance may emerge in real-world applications, this could affect the long-term therapeutic benefits of the PVC system. Future research should address this issue to provide comprehensive data support for the practical application of the PVC system.
5. Evaluation of biocompatibility: As a novel biotreatment approach, the biocompatibility of the PVC system must be thoroughly evaluated. A comprehensive biocompatibility assessment is essential before the widespread clinical implementation of the PVC system to ensure its safety for both humans and the environment.

In conclusion, this study provides initial experimental evidence for the application of the PVC system in the treatment of Vibrio cholerae infections. To widely apply the PVC system in clinical settings, further research is needed in areas such as increasing sample size, optimizing experimental conditions, refining modification strategies, investigating bacterial resistance, and conducting biocompatibility evaluations. Based on these advancements, the PVC system could potentially become an innovative and effective treatment modality for the prevention and treatment of bacterial infectious diseases like cholera.
