  Fig.1 The SDS-PAGE results for the amplification of the three proteins
 
  
  As shown in Figure 1, the gel electrophoresis results display the three proteins extracted from colony 1, colony 2, and colony 3 after amplification. In the figure, “M” represents the marker, providing a reference for the molecular sizes of the three proteins, which helps us assess their sizes. "PVC15" refers to the protein translated from the PVC1-16 fragment with PVC13 knocked out (the part encoding the tail fiber protein), leaving only the outer shell of the PVC system, ensuring its structural integrity after the tail fiber protein is replaced. "GP20" is the tail fiber protein from T4 bacteriophage, which specifically recognizes Vibrio cholerae. "VgrG3" represents a toxin protein. Based on the gel results and the known molecular weights, the sizes of the extracted proteins match their theoretical values.
 
In order to certify which structure mainly perform functions in the bacterial-killing procedure,  we then conduct the Sterilisation experiments on checkerboard point panels by mixing specific proteins with EPI300, the target bacterium in our project.

  Fig.2  The antibiotic test on EPI300
  
  (Left: the experimental group; Middle: the control group with PVC 13 gene absent,; Right: the control group with payload VGRG3 gene absent. The concentration of the protein changed for 1.25 mg/ml to 10 mg/ml (from A to D).)
 
Figure showed that the reconstructed PVC system can not perform its functions without either tail fiber or payload. The function would be sound only if the system contains tail fiber (for specific recognition) and payload (for toxic killing).

  Fig.3 PVC caused the rupture of Vibrio cholerae
  
  After preliminary determination of the killing effect through the growth of colonies on agar plates, we incubated PVC with Vibrio cholerae and captured electron micrographs during the killing process. These micrographs revealed ruptures in the cell membranes of the vibrios, with cellular contents leaking out. And various forms of PVC particles, both in pre-contraction and contraction states are observed. With this, we have confirmed that PVC indeed targets and binds to Vibrio cholerae, achieving bactericidal effects.

  Fig.4 Electron micrographs after PVC completed the killing
  
  (A: The PVC fiber under lower multiply; 
  
  B: The PVC fiber under higher multiply;

C: the pre-contraction step, the tail fiber was kept in and only spike was exposed;

D: the recognition step, the tail fiber recognized the receptor on the bacteria and fixed;

E: the contraction step, the sheath contracted to penetrate the spike into the cell.）
 
   The figure showed the complete process for a PVC fiber to function, which gave evidence to the antibiotics tests.
